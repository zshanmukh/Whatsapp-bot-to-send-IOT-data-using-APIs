# Whatsapp-bot-to-send-IOT-data-using-APIs

It is an IOT project in which we can send data we got from IoT device to WhatsApp after processing.
it sends an alert message to whatsapp when temperatures rises to above certain level.
I used Webhooks, IFTTT, Arduino, Temperature sensor data, and Twilio APIs to create this.
